# Remix Auth Email Link

Passwordless authentication by sending a magic link to your email. This example is using [remix-auth](https://github.com/sergiodxa/remix-auth) and [remix-auth-email-link](https://github.com/pbteja1998/remix-auth-email-link) packages.

## Example

This is using `remix-auth` and `remix-auth-email-link` packages. Instead of actually sending the magic link to the email, in this example I am just logging it on to the console. You can then copy/paste that into the URL. For sending the email you'll likely want to use an email service like SendGrid or Mailgun.
