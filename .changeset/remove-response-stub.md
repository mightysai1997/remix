Single Fetch: Remove `responseStub` in favor of `headers`

- Background

  - The original Single Fetch approach was based on an assumption that an eventual `middleware` implementation would require something like `ResponseStub` so users could mutate `status`/`headers` in `middleware` before/after handlers as well as during handlers
  - We wanted to align how `headers` got merged between document and data requests
  - So we made document requests also use `ResponseStub` and removed the usage of `headers` in Single Fetch
  - The realization/alignment between Michael and Ryan on the recent [roadmap planning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5z_axCofW0) made us realize that the original assumption was incorrect
  - `middleware` won't need a stub - users can just mutate the `Response` they get from `await next()` directly
  - With that gone, and still wanting to align how `headers` get merged, it makes more sense to stick with the current `headers` API and apply that to Single Fetch and avoid introducing a totally new thing in `RepsonseStub` (that always felt a bit awkward to work with anyway)

- With this change:
  - You are encouraged to stop returning `Response` instances in favor of returning raw data from loaders and actions:
    - ~~`return json({ data: whatever });`~~
    - `return { data: whatever };`
  - In most cases, you can remove your `json()` and `defer()` calls in favor of returning raw data if they weren't setting custom `status`/`headers`
    - We will be removing both `json` and `defer` in the next major version, but both _should_ still work in Single Fetch in v2 to allow for incremental adoption of the new behavior
  - If you need custom `status`/`headers`:
    - We've added a new `unstable_data({...}, responseInit)` utility that will let you send back `status`/`headers` alongside your raw data without having to encode it into a `Response`
  - The `headers()` function will let you control header merging for both document and data requests
