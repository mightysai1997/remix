The `create-remix` CLI has been rewritten to feature a cleaner interface, Git repo initialization and optional `remix.init` script execution. The interactive template prompt and official Remix stack/template shorthands have also been removed so that community/third-party templates are now on a more equal footing.

The code for `create-remix` has been moved out of the Remix CLI since it's not intended for use within an existing Remix application. This means that the `remix create` command is no longer available.
