Add a new `future.v3_relativeSplatPath` flag to implement a breaking bug fix to relative routing when inside a splat route. For more information, please see the React Router [`6.21.0` Release Notes](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/blob/release-next/CHANGELOG.md#futurev7_relativesplatpath) and the [`useResolvedPath` docs](https://remix.run/hooks/use-resolved-path#splat-paths).
