        Thank you for helping to improve Remix!

        The fastest way to get your bug fixed is to provide the best reproduction you can.

        üèÜ The most helpful option is to use our _bug report integration test_ template:

        1. [Fork `remix-run/remix`](https://github.com/remix-run/remix/fork)
        2. Open [`integration/bug-report-test.ts`](https://github.com/remix-run/remix/blob/dev/integration/bug-report-test.ts) in your editor
        3. Follow the instructions and submit a pull request with a failing bug report test!

        If you'd rather open a GitHub issue, here are your other options for sharing a reproduction (ordered from most helpful to least):

        - ü•á Link to a [StackBlitz](https://stackblitz.com/?starters=fullstack) environment
        - ü•à Link to a GitHub repository
